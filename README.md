Team 4: Deposit Forecasting and Stress Testing Deposits

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze and forecast the gross deposits of FDIC-insured banks under various economic conditions using advanced modeling techniques such as ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost and Prophet. By incorporating a stress test scenario (fed fund rate cut rate environment), the project aims to evaluate the potential impacts on bank deposits. This analysis provides actionable insights into the resilience of banks in response to economic shocks.
